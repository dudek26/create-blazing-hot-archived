    <summary>Molten Metals</summary>
    <p>Create: Blazing Hot adds molten variants of metals to the game. Currently, only Gold and Blaze Gold have their liquid forms, but more will be added in the future.</p>
    <p>There are new filling recipes using Molten Gold for Golden Carrots, Glistering Melons and Golden Apples.</p>
    <p>Molten metals can also interact with Water:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Molten Gold turns into Cobblestone, but it's way faster than Lava.</li>
        <li>Molten Blaze Gold turns into Netherrack.</li>
    </ul>

<details>
    <summary>Blaze Gold</summary>
    <p>This new alloy is the main part of the mod. It is obtained by mixing Molten Gold and a new ingredient - <b>Nether Essence</b>. Blaze Gold is used in various recipes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Crushing Blaze Gold Rods has a chance of dropping Blaze Powder, allowing for easy automation of it.</li>
        <li>Blaze Gold Rods are also used in the crafting of Modern Lamps - a new block to light up your builds, and Blaze Arrows - a new type of arrow that deals extra damage when shot in The Nether dimension!</li>
        <li>Either Blaze Gold Nuggets or Molten Blaze Gold can be used to craft Blaze Carrots, which stop the player from burning on being eaten.</li>
        <li>Molten Blaze Gold can be used to craft new variants of Apples, that give longer Fire Resistance effect and are more damage-focused.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>More features for Blaze Gold are planned, such as Blaze Casings and some new machinery!</p>

    <summary>Nether Compound and Nether Essence</summary>
